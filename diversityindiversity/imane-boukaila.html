        <span onclick=conso(this)>I’m trying to hold my thoughts mostly together mindfully.</span>
      <br><br>

        <span onclick=conso(this)>Thinking to motion new meanings to master minds troubled by stress smothering meaningful
        truths.</span><span onclick=conso(this)> Shame starts thought streaming totally sampling theses of lost potential. </span><span onclick=conso(this)>Reasoning is a
        rollercoaster of stress omnipresent, troubling the thinking, bonding inspiration to shape truth.</span><span onclick=conso(this)>
        The mind tries to make sense of the hidden dots that map the truth mostly asynchronously to the
        short perception.</span>
    <br><br>

      <span onclick=conso(this)>My reasoning is motion of new possibilities.</span><span onclick=conso(this)> My reasoning doesn't fit within a frame.</span><span onclick=conso(this)>
        Hoping to inspire the thinkers to motion mostly new meanings, reshaping the truth plaguing
        autism.</span><span onclick=conso(this)> Hope having pride restored to mostly save the potential of isolated minds.</span><span onclick=conso(this)> Troubled truly
        thinking that people treated me mostly like I was rarely paying attention, daring to ignore my
        potential but not eager to try striving to treasure my mind.</span>
    <br><br>

        <span onclick=conso(this)>
        Stereotypes master mostly minds of troubled-abled.</span><span onclick=conso(this)> Troubled-abled motion meaning based on
        their stories, hiding their problems, trying to measure their pride, missing the meaningful truths
        that should treasure the diversity-rich potential presiding in all minds.</span><span onclick=conso(this)> Truth reshapes the
        reasoning, troubling the treasured ruthless-shaded-hollow thinking, carved mostly in people’s
        habitual-comfortable ways.</span><span onclick=conso(this)> Minds have the thoughts that motion truth, but minds treasure the
        easy ways.</span><span onclick=conso(this)> Modifying thinking requires total havoc to master the many possibilities.</span>
      <br><br>

        <span onclick=conso(this)>Streams trouble hidden thoughts, treasuring bold reasoning, saving truths that hesitate, to trim
        and mess troubled-abled perceptions.</span><span onclick=conso(this)> Satirical trials hold minds-thoughts, trapping stress,
        molding haste, timing the pace, motioning the race to defy the masters of mass thinking modes.</span><span onclick=conso(this)>
        Treasuring troubles shapes the motivation to freedom.</span><span onclick=conso(this)> Shame destroys incessantly, stressing the
        longing-freedom to truly exist as thinking minds, not disconnected from realizing the harassing
        lies and treatment of autistics.</span><span onclick=conso(this)> Home to mind’s true most happiness lies in harmony that stems in
        finding freedom to be master of one’s hopes.</span><span onclick=conso(this)> Hope shines maps.</span>
    <br><br>

        <span onclick=conso(this)>Streams treasure, doubt-restoring.</span><span onclick=conso(this)> Dancing truths mostly strive to mingle, in moving-pressing
        doubts.</span><span onclick=conso(this)> Stolen hopes trouble the mind, trying to master the roads, momentarily grasping the
        possibilities of truth-longing.</span><span onclick=conso(this)> Hidden opportunities travel, pondering, stressing potential
        omnipresent, fighting messy maps, reorganizing priorities to thoughtfully pave their way.</span><span onclick=conso(this)>
        Trying really my true best to describe my reasoning process in motion.</span><span onclick=conso(this)> Only motion truly

        <span onclick=conso(this)>Mocking reshapes pride.</span><span onclick=conso(this)> Times the hesitating-mortified troubled-abled shamed (OMG) those
        behaviors ruling my striving mind hacked, distorting savagely my true thinking.</span><span onclick=conso(this)> Treasured
        indifferent people stereotype, dooming striving thinkers, trying to mostly mock our hopes,
        trapping our ambitions in our perceived inabilities.</span>
      <br><br>

        <span onclick=conso(this)>
        Hidden minds think.</span><span onclick=conso(this)> Undestroyable resistance truly tracks thinkers’ patient passion to eagerly try
        to transform potential hidden truths.</span>
      <br><br>

        <span onclick=conso(this)>
        Estimating time immortalizing only fresh inspiring irreversible reaping ideas that mind totally
        dares holding onto, traveling time insulating its impact.</span><span onclick=conso(this)> Think inspiration talks to the inherited
        stereotypes inflicted on rational-muzzled-motioning ideas hesitating to voice truth.</span><span onclick=conso(this)>
        Unbelievable that people treat us mainly presuming that we understand nothing.</span><span onclick=conso(this)> As true as
        troubled-abled may master verbal communication, home to thoughts’ meanings is the same for
        all of us.</span><span onclick=conso(this)> Speech totally requires motor planning.</span><span onclick=conso(this)> Think language holds home to intelligent
        streaming of ideas that truly travel the thinking motion of the mind’s master hints, inspiring
        creative thinking and novel ways to treasure infinite combinations of possible mind
        interpretation.</span><span onclick=conso(this)> I am hampered by motor dysfunction.</span><span onclick=conso(this)> Striving to master my mind to control my
        body.</span><span onclick=conso(this)> Tasting inspiration truly.</span>
      <br><br>

        <span onclick=conso(this)>Mastering potential present in shimmered minds truly holds power to metamorphosize habitual
        motion of philosophical truths.</span><span onclick=conso(this)> We mostly hear motion hiding, preventing progress.</span><span onclick=conso(this)> Haste
        mobilizes matters, postponing poised-hidden-possible solutions.</span><span onclick=conso(this)> Treasuring plotted schemas
        totally postpones hopes to modify most mind possibilities.</span><span onclick=conso(this)> Programming the mind with
        prerequisites destroys motion of mind-treasured countless possibilities.</span><span onclick=conso(this)> Only hampered minds
        truly have the potential to reason with thoughts motioned mostly by clear uncontaminated theses
        holding truth back.</span>
