  <p class="c1"><span class="c11">&nbsp;An artistic project that intra-acts collaboration with autistic experience</span></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c0">This project is a collaboration with my son Adam Wolfond in expressing his experiences as a non-speaking autistic person who types and moves to communicate. It is supported as a way of intra-acting a collaborative ethnography that thinks about different sensorimotor and perceptual experience, and our mutual encounters with the systemic exclusion of non-speaking autistic people. We name this intra-action as the way Adam discusses the relational importance of objects for movement and perception. The intra differs from &ldquo;inter&rdquo; in that the dualistic subject/object lines blur, calling to question the hierarchy of the non-autistic/human in relation. This acknowledges that collaboration is always mutual.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Other than this introduction, the text in this piece is written by Adam Wolfond. Adam argues that support is integral to his access to community, education and creation. He frequently discusses the importance of &ldquo;good support&rdquo; that recognizes his own ways of intra-acting with the world. Art, he says, allows for openings and his key interests are movement and rhythm as it co-composes with non/human objects. Our regular discussions and art-making experiments emerge processually and in relation. The artworks included are by both collaborators. This project is also part of a dissertation project where Adam is a collaborator.</span></p>

The water sometimes lingers and too much language is hot and painful. For others, the water is cold and fast. But the palm of my hand is the language of lasting friendship. The hand things with people who support love and illustrates my language.</span></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c4">Art uses things to assemble meaning and amazing art pays. But this is not art. Art can mean a lot and can be a lot of things. A resting point that people want is a way that we can express in typing a reality with outward thoughts. Art is the way of lots of easy feeling and isn&rsquo;t landings of meaning. Art doesn&rsquo;t necessarily pander to minds that lands meaning. Good art is about really open ideas. Art is profound because it ignores intention. Feeling freedom is the most important thing in my art&hellip; I am worried about the way people always want to have community and causes but I think that community is about care about how all feelings are important. </span></p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c4">Art is a feeling in my body. I want art toward tough and terrific feelings. It opens channels of feeling that makes the world come alive.</span></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c4">My body feels like a pulsating form of paint and I can&rsquo;t assemble my thoughts as you would like. I can&rsquo;t feel some parts of myself [and I] can&rsquo;t control my movements the way people want.</span></p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c4">I am wanting razor sharp always feeling body to be very calm and I want the body to wash away like the water you use. I want water to always give me answers about how to stay quiet in my body. My body is always trying to stay calm. Talking as you do is away from the not very calm hated body talks. Hated is calming way of Adam and always questioning, asking people.</span></p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c4">I like the way the water moves and how it really is smart. It is smart like how I am neatly about movement. Water is awesome cascade of my thoughts like a smooth game of forging feeling. Water lands my thoughts of moving when I can&rsquo;t move.</span></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c4">Thinking and communicating is a lesson I&rsquo;ve learned and being able to show that is wonderful but I also want people to face my autism as if I am ace of Adam&rsquo;s amazing all ways of communication, including my movements, art and singing. I am worried that my inability to talk will possibly seem like I&rsquo;m not interested but I am an always noticing alert person and not all arranged like a person who is not aware.</span></p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c4">I like questions and think the resonating ones are about the way I see things and good answers are always patient. But I sometimes think that my positive personality trait is my ability to pander to answering appalling applauding people locking answers of my reason away.</span></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c4">Time is perceived by the appreciation of language but I am pace of my body and not language. My body pacing is the task of feeling my body and the feeling of the pace of the environment I am feeling. The work is answering in a logical way about part of the amazing senses but I am not sensing the same way. I am always feeling a lot of things and it&rsquo;s hard to have concentration when I am not able to be at the talking-table but in the feelings of the world.</span></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c4">I am a lot of the time thinking about how to move. I want the art to have a feeling of boy&rsquo;s assembling of really tough movement. I want good art about movement to give people the ideas of the way I don&rsquo;t answer in words. I think that people ask questions to assembled ideas that always please them and hope sometimes that questions are backed by boy&rsquo;s typing.</span></p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c4">I think that language is lost in the walk, not like want of the words that long for in the classroom. My art opens understandings of autism that feels relations with good people and my environment. Activating movement for me is because of the support the body has feeling with another body. I want art about movement to give people ideas about the way I don&rsquo;t answer in words.</span></p>

  <p class="c2"><span class="c4">Collaboration happens by managing movement together. Collaboration is important because it is the coming together of important family of movement to open the idea of the mind and body. I want to question how the open body needs support. The open body is the feeling of a kite making flight. What I am talking about is our relationship to each other. Does a good body have a way to feel without another body?</span></p>

		<p class="c2"><span class="c0">This project is a collaboration with my son Adam Wolfond in expressing his experiences as a non-speaking autistic person who types and moves to communicate. It is supported as a way of intra-acting a collaborative ethnography that thinks about different sensorimotor and perceptual experience, and our mutual encounters with the systemic exclusion of non-speaking autistic people. We name this intra-action as the way Adam discusses the relational importance of objects for movement and perception. The intra differs from &ldquo;inter&rdquo; in that the dualistic subject/object lines blur, calling to question the hierarchy of the non-autistic/human in relation. This acknowledges that collaboration is always mutual.</span></p>
	<br><br></div>
	<div id="nine">
	<p class="c2"><span class="c0">Other than this introduction, the text in this piece is written by Adam Wolfond. Adam argues that support is integral to his access to community, education and creation. He frequently discusses the importance of &ldquo;good support&rdquo; that recognizes his own ways of intra-acting with the world. Art, he says, allows for openings and his key interests are movement and rhythm as it co-composes with non/human objects. Our regular discussions and art-making experiments emerge processually and in relation. The artworks included are by both collaborators. This project is also part of a dissertation project where Adam is a collaborator.</span></p>

	Art uses things to assemble meaning and amazing art pays.
	But this is not art. Art can mean a lot and can be a lot of things.
	A resting point that people want is a way that we can express in typing a reality with outward thoughts. Art is the way of lots of easy feeling and isn’t landings of meaning. Art doesn’t necessarily pander to minds that lands meaning. Good art is about really open ideas. Art is profound because it ignores intention. Feeling freedom is the most important thing in my art… I am worried about the way people always want to have community and causes but I think that community is about care about how all feelings are important.

		Collaboration happens by managing movement together. Collaboration is important because it is the coming together of important family of movement to open the idea of the mind and body. I want to question how the open body needs support. The open body is the feeling of a kite making flight. What I am talking about is our relationship to each other. Does a good body have a way to feel without another body?

	I move very often because I am packing the ill pace of the boy’s language. I lack the ability to not hesitate my movements and I long for having ability to have my language flow. I often run away because the language you speak is fast-paced and I need to think about my amazing body. I want my body to land like an airplane. In the place of language I am in lots of clouds. I name lots of co-pilots as my helpings to land my good thoughts.

	Animals are considered less than people. I am the dread of people like animals because if I don’t talk then people will not really respect how in my mind I deal with welling interesting thoughts. People who don’t talk are upset about those who do not understand how good we are without speech and I will pass assail you with my intelligence. I will prove that I am intelligent. Unfortunately, people want proof. Nothing is proper in this world without language and people are loathing things they cannot see.

		Words are important for communication but they slap me in the face like the hard force of the train. Words are force full and ask me to speak when I can’t.

I am happy with a body that communicates….Noticing who I am on the inside is always hard for people because everyone sees only the way they really want to. It’s hard to change their minds.

	  <p class="c2"><span class="c0">This project is a collaboration with my son Adam Wolfond in expressing his experiences as a non-speaking autistic person who types and moves to communicate. It is supported as a way of intra-acting a collaborative ethnography that thinks about different sensorimotor and perceptual experience, and our mutual encounters with the systemic exclusion of non-speaking autistic people. We name this intra-action as the way Adam discusses the relational importance of objects for movement and perception. The intra differs from &ldquo;inter&rdquo; in that the dualistic subject/object lines blur, calling to question the hierarchy of the non-autistic/human in relation. This acknowledges that collaboration is always mutual.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Other than this introduction, the text in this piece is written by Adam Wolfond. Adam argues that support is integral to his access to community, education and creation. He frequently discusses the importance of &ldquo;good support&rdquo; that recognizes his own ways of intra-acting with the world. Art, he says, allows for openings and his key interests are movement and rhythm as it co-composes with non/human objects. Our regular discussions and art-making experiments emerge processually and in relation. The artworks included are by both collaborators. This project is also part of a dissertation project where Adam is a collaborator.</span></p>

	  <p class="c2"><span class="c4">Art uses things to assemble meaning and amazing art pays. But this is not art. Art can mean a lot and can be a lot of things. A resting point that people want is a way that we can express in typing a reality with outward thoughts. Art is the way of lots of easy feeling and isn&rsquo;t landings of meaning. Art doesn&rsquo;t necessarily pander to minds that lands meaning. Good art is about really open ideas. Art is profound because it ignores intention. Feeling freedom is the most important thing in my art&hellip; I am worried about the way people always want to have community and causes but I think that community is about care about how all feelings are important. </span></p>

I often run away because the language you speak is fast-paced and I need to think about my amazing body. I want my body to land like an airplane. In the place of language I am in lots of clouds. I name lots of co-pilots as my helpings to land my good thoughts.</span></p>

	  <p class="c2"><span class="c4">I see the objects and focus on assembled parts like the house and not the door and because I don&rsquo;t see the door I manage by doing lots of amazing things like pacing my movements to the same way as my assistants. I see the whole but not the same whole as other people&hellip;really, they are not able to see the blast of the whole like I do. They can see the school but I can see everything gathering in the hallway moving; the forging of movements of movement. Van Gogh is not like how I see but I manage the moments of movement like a painter who is landing the boy&rsquo;s thoughts and perceptions.</span></p>

	  <p class="c2"><span class="c4">Animals are considered less than people. I am the dread of people like animals because if I don&rsquo;t talk then people will not really respect how in my mind I deal with welling interesting thoughts. People who don&rsquo;t talk are upset about those who do not understand how good we are without speech and I will pass assail you with my intelligence. I will prove that I am intelligent. Unfortunately, people want proof. Nothing is proper in this world without language and people are loathing things they cannot see.</span></p>
	  <p class="c2"><span class="c4">Words are important for communication but they slap me in the face like the hard force of the train. Words are force full and ask me to speak when I can&rsquo;t. People say it is easy to talk like sailing along an easy ride but they are also always talking and not saying very much. I am happy with a body that communicates&hellip;.Noticing who I am on the inside is always hard for people because everyone sees only the way they really want to. It&rsquo;s hard to change their minds.</span></p>

I am talking about my want to talk. I think I can accept my artful way of writing but I want wall of speaking to tall order to come down. Neurodiversity is accepting my inability to talk but I want to talk. Disability is not being able to do certain things calling eager wants ramming for real thinking about acceptance. I can do lots of things and I can think.</span></p>
