  <b>Monkey D. Luffy, the fifth emperor</b>
  <br><br>
    After the adventures in WCI, Monkey D. Luffy's bounty has been raised to 1.5 Billion Berry! This extraordinary amount, as is written in "World Economic journal" news, puts Luffy squarely with the 4 yonko in terms of bounty. It is for this reason that "Big News" Morgan writes, "the fifth emperor of the seas has appeared!" An astonishing feat, we can easily say!!!<br><br>
