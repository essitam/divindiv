<div class=WordSection1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Autism is no mere ignorance. It is an
achievement. There is much learning and memorizing involved to perfect autism.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>This learning is beyond the world of history
and mathematics where one just has to learn what every one learns - formulas
and names of battle heroes. Perfecting autism is by far a journey of an
explorer. I explored right from the beginning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>When I was beginning to categorize my memory,
smelling on the starched white table cloth corners at a doctor’s traditionally
decorated office in India, where white ironed creases of the table cloth had
captivated my vision, I realized I needed to rise up to the moment. I rose up
to explore. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Since I was getting a label anyway, what did I
have to lose?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I went across the room and picked up a thing
or two like paper weights and clips to inhale their ‘out of the world’ smells.
Vision is cognitive; smelling is limbic. Smell creates a mood and you smell
once more. Emotions evolve and you remember. Never mind the emotions! At least
you remember those creases and the smells.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>One memorizes the smells better than sight. I
will never be in a limbo if I smelled starch again. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>That day I was given a diagnosis. As the Pope
coronated Charlemagne The doctor coronated me with a whole world. ‘He is in his
own world!’ </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I was supposed to be in a world of my own.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>And I memorized straight lines and creases. I
lined up my toys as part of my duty to organize them in a system. I traced the
corners of the walls to perfection.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>In a time called ‘meanwhile’, I was happy to
be as ignorant - as those simple unidimensional creases and lines. Don’t even
tell me there are plane two dimensional surfaces. Then one day I learned about
chaos.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>We were passengers of a train taking us from
Mysore to Bangalore. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I was focussed that day, gravitating all the
possible points of the world at that newspaper crease - the familiarity of the
line, the backbone, the meridian - separating printed this side of the paper
from that side of the printed newspaper. I was waiting for the man sitting in
front of me in the train whose face never mattered to me, to finish reading it
and fold it along that crease. The train moved with gentleness. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Then he got up abruptly, grabbing the pages in
the carelessly managed manner and left the train at the next station. The
creases were ignored - as if there was nothing called folding the paper along
the crease! I had to get up to follow that newspaper. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>‘Where are YOU off to?’ Mother put me back on
the seat. ‘We don’t get off here. We have an hour left’. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>That day I learned there is more chaos and
nobody actually has anything to lose. I lost interest in lining up my toys
after that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Once I learned chaos I recognized it
everywhere. In the randomness of airports, people’s dialogues and in the great
American special education system.  But I am not here to detail every chaos.
This essay is about the awareness of entropic journey towards perfection.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Generations of doctors have given names to the
human differences to create some kind of organized category. There are some
children displaying certain traits of repetitive movements and focussed
interests. They ought to have a diagnosis. A diagnosis, after all - helps in
the reduction of human dignity. My focussed interests evolved from one thing to
another.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>I was studying the reflection of the light on
this specific door knob - how light converged in that central point with
diminished deformity. The humiliation of that reduced outcome of reflection was
a parody towards all that external properties of light. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>There was much to lose. All the luminosity of
the glowing bulb was reduced by several lux, lost in the understanding of a
brass door knob. Polishing up the door knob wouldn’t glow the reduced
reflections. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>That day I learned the final chapter - what
can one expect out of door knobs? Understanding of autism by collective masses
is like the light trapped within that knob.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Arguing and advocating is a futile waste.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Meanwhile let me perfect my autism.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>- </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN>Tito</span></p>
