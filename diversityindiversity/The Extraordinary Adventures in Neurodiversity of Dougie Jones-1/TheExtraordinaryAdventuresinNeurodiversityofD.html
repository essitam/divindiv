  <p class="c22"><span class="c28 c0"><img src="images/tenor.gif">We have not tried to argue for nor are we interested in analysis or some sort of critical excavation. In the middle, we are merely thinking with the intensities that come to the foreground waiting for Cooper. That no one has time for Dougie simply means there is no time that such adventures adhere to; rather it creates time, continuously. Thus when we are thinking with, we are always fabulating conceptions alongside the sensations, so while we approach Dougie as an aesthetic figure, what might in turn emerge is a conceptual persona. But this is not of us, it is of the writing and what it does, as its own practice. As a practice we&#39;ve always maintained it, moving in and out on the to-and-fro of the pulls and pushes. In other words, the practice of writing itself was moved by the lures brought forward in the suspense, the fall, the melodies, the differing appetites that we encountered with Dougie.</span><img></p><p class="c19"><span class="c37 c7"></span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c37 c7">&ldquo;In fact, it seems that what follows from this insight is not the &ldquo;dissolving&rdquo; of the self, but, we might say, a holding of it in a lighter, more contingente manner - as, precisely, a fiction (and, insofar as the self is the other anchor point for numerous other fictions - the different worlds through which a self moves - then these are too seen as fictions). Crucially, this might also mean the possibility of producing other fictions of the self (or other fictions of the non-self), and with that the exploration of other ways of being in the world.&rdquo; (O&rsquo;Sullivan, 2018, p. 310). </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c7 c59 c34">fiction without hooks?</span><span class="c7 c59">&nbsp;</span><span class="c7 c34 c59">fabulation</span><sup class="c7 c59 c34"><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup></p><p class="c6 c23"><span class="c29 c73 c78"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">The Old-Dougie, if we can call him that, used to be married to Janey-E.

The right to exist is therefore also a juridical issue. e.g: the spectres were slowly diminished and de-graded until their partial disappearance from the world of mainstream Christian philosophy/religion, being substituted by an official demonology with grades of agency (from high to low demons).

Attractors, they reorient the whole cartography of desires of a group subjectivity, defy identiarian and ideological positions, put all the subjects in motion. The Visitor and his intensity poked desires that were not publicly accepted by the old Italian macho godfather of the house, but they were there, activated. Suddenly he, the maid, the daughter, the mother, the postman, everybody had new and strong desires oriented to that gorgeous body. Yes, sometimes it&#39;s totalizing, and not always (we hope) under the form of a charming man, but as, for example, travelling ferns that enter into an environment and less-human creatures. And as Dougie, he (The Visitor) lately disappeared. Things disappear, and they get missing, d.B. Cooper is still missing, the cosmic diagrammatic distribution of thingies in the space eats things. &ldquo;Where is my hairpin?&rdquo; Kaboom! Dodraugen! Resting in the fern pot. When the cut is not anymore cutting, metastable, things can seem to return to a state of affairs but they&#39;re never the same. The event and the schizz reoriented all perspectives, opening to new iterations. Janey-y opens the door. A new Dougie returned. A new, but the same. Instead of celebrating Cooper&#39;s return we must stay with the problem, stay with Dougie - not the problem, but the cuts that makes both unity and uniformity of a world shattered, disrupted. Dougie&#39;s body is at a limit, cannot be displaced anymore, otherwise garmonbozia will lose its elasticity.

The refusal of non-identity by most of digital services is the refusal of the affirmation of spectrality. Spectres are what defy unity, coherence, the univocity of Being. We should not see a non-identity as a agglutination that itself becomes a identity but as the schism that breaks the stuckness of fixed identitarian systems. Secondly, a spectre is always a community of the spectres, always more than one, Dougie is never only Dougie, but Cooper, Old Dougie, Mr. C, BOB, etc., a pool of parasitical minimal existences that at the same time move together but individuate according to different patterns of time, space and general enabling constraints.

Dougie Jones offers resistance against such aggregators and their quantifying violence, for dougie is multiplicitous and feels with the event rather than unifying the affect into a transcendental ego. As much as it creates platforms of relations that do not personify, it also creates platforms that do not emotionalize (ooohooo, less or more empathy please!) dougie produces singular qualities ad infinitum as long as they are not captured by spectres of typicality, i.e. bob and the likes.

These characteristics probably have something to do with the impossibility of following neurotypical movements (see for bellow, for example, the </span><span class="c50 c69">images of dougie on the elevator </span><span class="c28 c0">and their struggle), but while his family and colleagues from work see dougie as lacking social abilities that somehow miraculously need to be fulfilled, we see Dougie&#39;s associality as the more than human, in the sense Erin Manning proposes it, &quot;we might think of asociality as that which is ecologically oriented and perseverative, that which extends notions of communion and relationality beyond the human&quot; (Yergeau, 2018, p. 71-72). An excess that resists capitalization, for Dougie time is not money, or we could say time is infinitely created (in the sense that Dougie&#39;s time cannot be put under a traditionally organized scheduled and circadian day due to their neurological conditions - condition not as a disease but as pure difference), as his almost infinite money could be worn due to dougie&#39;s abilities to think beyond the money, with the slot machines and the voices of the ghosts from red room. We should not, though, mysticize Dougie or make them look crazy to neurotypical eyes, as neurotypical eyes frequently see us through the (sometimes not so much) implicit discourse and gestures of ableism, but include neurotypicality on the continuum of neurodiversity. Dougie shall not be only a repository of victimization, but seen as a carrier of affirmative actions against the normalization of every aspect of the daily life. For obvious reasons not all, and many doors get closed to Dougie&rsquo;s mode of existence. We understand a mode of existence as &ldquo;the occupations of the spacetime, plus the necessary conditions for each mode of existence to create the spacetime it aims to occupy. The spacetime of the phenomena is not the same of the spacetime of the things, that&#39;s not the same of the spacetime of the imaginary being, etc.&rdquo; (Lapoujade, 2017, p. 17).</span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c15"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c11 c7">ft [5:43 PM]</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c11 c7">i think chit-cat-chat should be more valued</span></p><p class="c6 c23"><span class="c11 c7"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c11 c7">techniques to create time</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c11 c7">chit-chat is needed to confront the habitual logistical talks (i don&rsquo;t have time to lose)</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c11 c7">maybe we need to lose time no?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c11 c7">losing time according to the habitual roles of full agendas = creating time</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c11 c7">but also chit-cat-chat time is helpful to develop more fabulaton-pills</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c11 c7">also also there is this logic that implies: &ldquo;well if i am chit-chatting i should feel guilty because i didn&rsquo;t do anything&rdquo;&hellip; guilt is shit no?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c11 c7">the good thing is that dougie&rsquo;s body doesn&rsquo;t understand logics of being guilty</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c11 c7">:dougie:</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c11 c7">:otherdougie:</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c11 c7">there&rsquo;s always more time for coffee</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c11 c7">advvv [5:50 PM]</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 210.67px; height: 118.50px;"><img alt="" src="images/image19.gif" style="width: 210.67px; height: 118.50px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c11 c7">maybe fabulation-pills are what goes into the coffee, no?</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c11 c7">like Bergson&rsquo;s tea</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c11 c7">(slack creaturesque conversation on #FCLC channel)</span></p><p class="c6 c23"><span class="c11 c7"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c79 c116">&ldquo;If I want to mix a glass of sugar and water, I must, willy nilly, wait until the sugar melts.

They are this side of a Convenient Coma because there is still something there... they move, talk, eat, sleep, but they have no drive, ambition, or capacity for emotion.

Besides certain movements in some of Twin Peaks&#39; fandoms, everybody, including most of the fans, Gordon Cole, Diane (Tulpa or not) and other colleagues wanted Cooper&#39;s recovery, the cure to Dougie&#39;s disease, or Dougie as the disease that should be eliminated. Melanie Yergeau (2018, p. 117) also touches the problem of the idea of &#39;recovering&#39; from autism or other modes of existence present in the neuroqueer(ing) spectrum. &quot;Recovery, in the historiographical sense, suggests that something or someone must be surfaced&quot;, &quot;recovery speaks of an aberrance becoming norm, of relinquishing defect in favor of the default&quot; (ibid., p. 118). Who has time for Dougie as Dougie? Nobody, and only many. Perhaps Candy grasped some of Dougie&rsquo;s anguish for being taken as someone else. Never forget Richard and Linda. &quot;She&#39;s dead. Wrapped on plastic&quot;. During the first minutes of </span><span class="c0 c34">Twin Peaks: </span><span class="c28 c0">episode 1, this phrase secretly condensed one quality that transversed all beings living in the black lodge, white lodge or the world we fail to believe it&#39;s real: plasticity, or, in the terms we want to stand up for here: shape-shifting. The entities that may be usually related to black and white lodge are the Man from another Place&quot;, also known as the dancing dwarf, and the giant, their hobnob at the red room is close to our concept of &quot;parliament of creatures&quot;. Lately the Man from Another Place was transmuted into an arm, that grew on a tree branch, a creature, that we agree with the following writer, can be seen as a mischievous entity. &quot;Related to MFAP as his opposite outside of the Red Room is the Giant, whom Cooper meets in visions when he is awake. These two ghostly beings are not related to either good or evil; they seem to dwell somewhere in between that dichotomy, and establish the link between both. They are ghosts of liminality.&quot; (Elferen, 2010, p. 283). </span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 315.50px; height: 177.83px;"><img alt="" src="images/image11.png" style="width: 315.50px; height: 177.83px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c15"></span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c0">t</span><span class="c0">hat strange face looking at me. </span><span class="c0">t</span><span class="c28 c0">here are many coopers, when they-shape shift they might still look the same but become strange. &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c28 c0"></span></p><p class="c22"><span class="c0">100%. full intentionality. &ldquo;To be more precise, since the Indians are perfectly capable of adopting &ldquo;physical&rdquo; and &ldquo;functional&rdquo; attitudes </span><span class="c0 c34">sensu</span><span class="c28 c0">&nbsp;(Dennett, 1978) in everyday life, we will say that here we are faced with an epistemological ideal that, far from seeking to reduce &ldquo;ambient intentionality&rdquo; to its degree zero in order to attain an absolutely objective representation of the world, instead makes the opposite wager: true knowledge aims to reveal a maximum of intentionality through a systematic and deliberate abduction of agency.&rdquo; (Gell, 1988 apud Viveiros de Castro, 2015: 61) Full intentionality, like the Indians de Castro speaks of, does not concern intentionality as &lsquo;directed towards.&rsquo; Rather, neurodiverse experience lived by Dougie always abducts agency and its directionality to move with the schiz in a certain &lsquo;aroundness&rsquo; (Savarese, xx).

Not every situation fuelled by anthropomorphism is oriented to anthropocentrism. A chunk of non-consensual acts are, in our understanding, supposedly neither linguistically or non-linguistically approved. Should we trust a body that moves like a human?

The processes of subjectivation or semiotization are not centered on individual agents (on the operation of intrapsychic, egoic, microsocial agencies) or on group agents. These processes are doubly decentered. They involve machines of expression that can be of an extrapersonal, extra-individual nature (machinic, economic, social, technological, iconic, ecological, ethological, or media systems, in other words, systems that are no longer immediately anthropo- logical), or of an infrahuman, infrapsychic, infrapersonal nature (systems of perception, sensibility, affect, desire, representation, image, and value, modes of memorization and production of ideas, systems of inhibition and automation, corporal, organic, biological, or physiological systems, and so on).&quot; (Guattari, 2007, p. 43).</span></p></div><div><p class="c39"><a href="#ftnt_ref3" id="ftnt3">[3]</a><span class="c11 c7">&nbsp;Dougie Jones can only be considered a void only if they are a one that is populated but voices that don&rsquo;t decide to act through consensus, but by appetites. &ldquo;(...) in this sense, the &ldquo;itself&rdquo; is an illusion that veils the subject&rsquo;s fundamental disjunction, who cannot say &ldquo;I&rdquo;, but in so far she or he recognizes that her or himself is a void populated by the supra-human voices.

The same level of performance is not expected of the onscreen male - he just has to get a hard-on, do a bit of thrusting and shoot his load. The work is done by the woman. The x-rated film viewer identifies more with her than with the male protagonist. As in any film you identify with the main character. Porn is also the method men use to imagine what they would do if they were women, how they would apply themselves to satisfying other men, what good sluts they&#39;d be, what prick-devourers&quot;. </span></p></div><div><p class="c16"><a href="#ftnt_ref8" id="ftnt8">[8]</a><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c49 c2">I will eat you all alive</span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c49 c2">I will eat you all alive</span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c49 c2">&quot;I will eat you all alive</span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c49 c2">I will eat you all alive</span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c2 c49">And there&#39;ll be no more lies</span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c49 c2">There&#39;ll be no more lies</span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c49 c2">There&#39;ll be no more lies</span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c49 c2">&quot;There&#39;ll be no more lies&quot;</span></p><p class="c16"><span class="c9 c7"><a class="c53" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D-3ZUQMBD5yI&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1533073982516000">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3ZUQMBD5yI</a></span></p></div><div><p class="c39"><a href="#ftnt_ref9" id="ftnt9">[9]</a><span class="c11 c7">&nbsp;Dougie is many (ness). </span></p></div><div><p class="c16"><a href="#ftnt_ref10" id="ftnt10">[10]</a><span class="c2">&nbsp;Dougie&rsquo;s expression, directed mostly towards non-linguistic communication, as edited into compilations videos on Youtube. &quot;Dougie&quot; Cooper - All Phrases (Twin Peaks Compilation). </span><span class="c9"><a class="c53" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DLm29Wc227iM&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1533073982519000">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lm29Wc227iM</a></span><span class="c21">&nbsp;(last accessed 06/23/2018)</span></p></div><div><p class="c39"><a href="#ftnt_ref11" id="ftnt11">[11]</a><span class="c2">&nbsp;&quot;It was established that Dougie would sometimes disappear for days.

As a neurodiverse, Dougie is not given any kind of agency beyond being a being that could be moulded according to the wishes of its creator, &#39;Bad Cooper&#39;. The concept of agency is problematic, and we agree that subjectivity is constructed through the metastable amalgamation of spectral traces that come mostly from the outside of the individual (and where does it end?), but not in a dispositive constituted by a puppet and its puppeteer, or the tupla and its tulpamancer. For the spectre is always more than one, never alone, emerging as a sociability, that is not, however, guided by a consensual system of decisions but filled with conflicting and mischievous appetites. Dougie Jones is always more than one.</span></p></div><div><p class="c16"><a href="#ftnt_ref12" id="ftnt12">[12]</a><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c34">Indiewire</span><span class="c2">: &quot;&lsquo;Twin Peaks&rsquo;: Why We Need Agent Cooper&rsquo;s Arrested Development Even When It&rsquo;s Exhausting&quot; </span><span class="c9 c7"><a class="c53" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.indiewire.com/2017/06/twin-peaks-2017-cooper-dougie-watch-tv-kyle-maclachlan-1201837756/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1533073982518000">http://www.indiewire.com/2017/06/twin-peaks-2017-cooper-dougie-watch-tv-kyle-maclachlan-1201837756/</a></span><span class="c11 c7">&nbsp;(last accessed 06/06/2018).</span></p></div><div><p class="c16"><a href="#ftnt_ref13" id="ftnt13">[13]</a><span class="c11 c7">&nbsp;&ldquo;Hey!
